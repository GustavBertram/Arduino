REPAD

REfactoring PAD

Developer's best friend :)

Repad is a 3x3 matrix keypad that you can configure each key to perform your favorite IDE refactoring or whatever you like (game combos, lock your computer, etc) 

You do this by writing a config file and uploading it to the repad.

= KEYPAD CONFIGURATION =

The repad keys can be configured using a text file where each line corresponds to a command. The first line must start with a "bs" command (bull sh... I mean "buffer start"). 

bs

Then you must configure 9 keys. Each individual key configuration starts with a "ks" command (key start/setup). There is no special command to indicate the key configuration end.

ks

At the end you must put a "be" command (buffer end)

For example this is a valid repad key configuration that binds no special meaning to each key:

bs	//buffer start
ks	//empty key
ks	//yes, comments are supported
ks	actually everything after the command is ignored :)
ks	//empty key
ks	//empty key
ks	//empty key
ks	//empty key
ks	//empty key
be	//buffer end

Repad configuration that binds Alt + Enter to the key on the center of the pad

bs
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
lalt	//press left alt
enter	//press enter
wa		//wait 25 milliseconds
ra		//release all keys
ks
ks
ks
be

Here is an example of a key bind to the Resharper rename refactor: Ctrl + R + R

ks		
lctrl	//press left ctrl
r		//press r
wa		//wait
rk		//release key (the key to relase is in the next command)
r		//release 'r'
wa		//wait
r		//press r again
w		//wait
ra		//release all keys

The repad allows you to create multiple key configurations and using the special key "menu switch" you can switch among them. For example if you want to configure three layouts you should configure 27 keys (3 layouts * 9 keys)

Example:

bs
ks	//first layout
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks	//second layout
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks	//third layout
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
be

Failing to follow these guidelines may yiels unpredicted/unexpected results.
