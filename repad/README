REPAD

REfactoring PAD

Developer's best friend :)

Repad is a 3x3 matrix keypad that you can configure each key to perform your favorite IDE refactoring... or whatever you like (game combos, lock your computer, etc) 

You do this by writing a config file and uploading it to the repad.

= KEYPAD CONFIGURATION =

The repad keys can be configured using a text file where each line corresponds to a command. The first line must start with a "bs" command (bull sh... I mean "buffer start"). 

bs

Then you must configure 9 keys. Each individual key configuration starts with a "ks" command (key start/setup). There is no special command to indicate the key configuration end.

ks

At the end you must put a "be" command (buffer end). Don't forget to hit enter! (line break)

For example this is a valid repad key configuration that binds no special meaning to each key:

bs	//buffer start
ks	//empty key
ks	//yes, comments are supported
ks	actually everything after the command is ignored :)
ks	//so no need to type //
ks	//empty key
ks	//empty key
ks	//empty key
ks	//empty key
be	//buffer end

Repad configuration that binds Alt + Enter to the key on the center of the pad

bs
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
lalt	//press left alt
enter	//press enter
wa		//wait 25 milliseconds
ra		//release all keys
ks
ks
ks
be

Here is an example of a key bind to the Resharper rename refactor: Ctrl + R + R

ks		
lctrl	//press left ctrl
r		//press r
wa		//wait
rk		//release key command (the key to be relased is in the next command)
r		//release 'r'
wa		//wait
r		//press r again
w		//wait
ra		//release all keys

The repad allows you to create multiple key configurations and using the special key "menu switch" you can switch among them. For example if you want to configure three layouts you should configure 27 keys (3 layouts * 9 keys)

Example:

bs
ks	//first layout
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks	//second layout
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks	//third layout
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
ks
be

You can define at most 10 layouts, but you are also limited to the total of bytes of your eeprom.

Failing to follow these guidelines may yield unpredicted/unexpected results.

= HOW TO UPLOAD THE CONFIGURATION =

Windows:

Find the COM port assigned to your repad. You can do this by running the mode command with your repad unpluged.

C:> mode

This will list all COM devices, then plug the repad and run "mode" again. The new COM device is your repad. Then configure the COM transmission settings to:

C:> mode COM21 BAUD=9600 PARITY=n DATA=8 STOP=1
(in my case the repad is on COM21)

Then just copy the mapping file to the COM port 

C:> copy mapping-numberpad.txt \\.\COM21

Thats it!

Hope you enjoy it,
